This code is a Matlab implementation of the tracking algorithm described in "Robust Visual Tracking via Sparse Representation under Subclass Discriminant Constraint" by
Cheng Qian. This version of the source code is just released for ease of understanding the algorithm.It is recommended that the demo be implemented with Matlab2012b.

----------- how to run the demo -----------
 
1. The image sequence is put into the directory "Images".
2. set the parameters in "MainTracking.m".
3. run MainTracking.
